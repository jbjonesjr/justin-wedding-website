<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>It all began on August 25, 2009 at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. It was the second day of school when two people's lives would change forever. Lanier was a sophomore member of Alpha Chi Omega, when she and her sorority sisters decided to go to the Lambda Chi's house. Justin was a junior and a member of Lambda Chi Alpha and that night when their eyes met, they knew it was something special. </p>

<h1>Things To Do</h1>
<p>While at the lake we encourage all of our guest to take advantage of the activities the area and lake has to offer. </p>


<h2>Activities At Bernard's Landing</h2>

<P>The Landing offers a lot of activities on property to accomodate every guest. The streets that connect the resort make a great trail for a morning run, a leisurely walk or for a quick bike ride.</P>  
 
<P>The resort also offers a full service gym to all guests which includes wieghts, exercise equipment, a jacuzzi and a sauna. </P>

<P> Smith Mountain Lake has some of the best Bass fishing in the area. If you are a novice or an expert bring your tackle box and try your luck. The resort has a great deal of water frontage with docks and other structures that can make for great fishing. </P>

<h2>Activities Off Property</h2>

<P> If you want to get off the property the lake and surrounding areas has a ton of destinations. </P>



<P>For the guests that want something a little more laid back you are only a short drive from a delicious glass of wine made locally in the New River Valley. Bernard's landing is close to two of the wineries that make up the Bedford Wine Trail. For more information on the wineries or a map of the other wineries that make up the trail <a target="_foo_wine" href="http://thebedfordwinetrail.com/">Click Here</a>.</P>


<P>If wine is not your style, you can enjoy a cold one at Sunken City Brewery. Sunken City is a local micro brewery that is a short 15 minute drive from Bernard's Landing and makes some great beer. <a target="_foo_beer" href="http://sunkencitybeer.com">Click Here</a> to check out their website. </P>

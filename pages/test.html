<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>It all began on August 25, 2009 at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. It was the second day of school when two people's lives would change forever. Lanier was a sophomore member of Alpha Chi Omega, when she and her sorority sisters decided to go to the Lambda Chi's house. Justin was a junior and a member of Lambda Chi Alpha and that night when their eyes met, they knew it was something special. </p>

<h2>Over the Years</h2>    
<p>Lanier and Justin spent the next few months getting to know each other. A few months turned into a couple years. In 2011 Justin graduated and decided he would remain at Tech to pursue a Master's Degree and spend more time with Lanier.</p>
<p>The following spring Lanier graduated from Tech and enrolled in the East Carolina University Physician Assistant program. Over the next year Lanier and Justin commuted between Greenville and Blacksburg. They quickly learned that even though they were five hours apart, it would take a lot more than distance to shake their relationship.</p>
<p>In 2013 Justin graduated with his Masters from Tech and started his career in Dothan, AL. After six months, Justin moved to Newburgh, IN to take a position as sales manager for Channel Seed. </p>   

 <h2>The Proposal</h2>     
 <p>Justin soon new that he wanted to marry Lanier and in the winter of 2014 he put that plan in motion. Justin designed the perfect ring and began to organize the perfect proposal. After much thought, Justin decided that the 4th of July was the perfect time to pop the question. Justin knew most of Lanier's family would be at Smith Mountain Lake for the holiday so he invited his parents as well.  </p>
 <p>On the evening of July 3rd, Justin grabbed a bottle of wine and walked hand and hand with Lanier to the dock. Awaiting them on the dock was a chiminea filled with firewood. On that cool summer night Justin and Lanier sat down in front of the fire, sipping wine, watching the stars and talking about life. When the moment was right, Justin dropped to one knee and popped the question. </p> 
 <p>She said YES!! And now we want to celebrate our special day with you. </p>

<p>We are very excited to share our special day with family and friends, as that is the best gift we could receive. However, for those who have generously asked if there is anything we need for our new house, we thank you. We have created a wish list which is available at myregistry.com. This link allows you to browse our wish list that is compiled of online and brick and mortar stores (individual lists are also avaialble in store at Crate & Barrel, Williams-Sonoma and Macy's. </p>

<p>We are very excited to share our special day with family and friends, as that is the best gift we could receive. However, for those who have generously asked if there is anything we need for our new house, we thank you.</p>
<p>To simplify the registry, we've have created a wish list which is available at myregistry.com which is comprised of multiple online and brick and mortar stores (individual lists are also avaialble in store at Crate & Barrel, Williams-Sonoma and Macy's). </p>

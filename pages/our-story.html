<p> Bird cage It all started back on August 25, 2009 at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. It was the second day of school when a group of friends got together and two people's lives would change forever. Lanier was a sophomore and a member of Alpha Chi Omega and on that warm Tuesday night, she and a group of friends decided to go meet up with the Lambda Chi's. Justin was a junior at the time and a member of Lambda Chi Alpha and that night when their eyes met, they knew it was love.</p>
<p>Lanier and Justin spent the next few months getting to know each other a little better. A few months turned into a couple years. In 2011 it came time for Justin to graduate and get a job in the real world, but instead of following this path, Justin decided he would stay in school to pursue a Master's Degree and spend more time with Lanier.</p>
<p>The following spring Lanier graduated from Virginia Tech and was accepted into the ECU Physician Assistant program. In August 2012 she moved to Greenville, NC to start the almost 3-year journey through graduate school. Over the next year Lanier and Justin commuted between Greenville and Blacksburg. They quickly learned that even though they were five hours apart, it would take a lot more than distance to shake their relationship.</p>
<p>In 2013 Justin graduated with his Masters from Virginia Tech and took his first job. Justin decided that he wanted to sell seed and the opportunity presented itself, but required him to relocate to Dothan, Alabama. All of a sudden the five hour drive became a plane ride.</p>
<p>Justin and Lanier knew that the job in Dothan was only temporary. In the fall of 2013 Justin took a more permanent position and moved to Newburgh, Indiana. Lanier and Justin continued to see each other as much as they could, and Lanier continued working toward her degree.</p>
<p>Justin knew from the beginning that he wanted to marry Lanier, but in the winter of 2014 he put the plan in motion. Justin spent months trying to organize the perfect proposal and design the perfect ring. After a lot of thought, Justin decided that the 4th of July was the perfect time. Justin knew that a lot of Lanier's family would be at Smith Mountain Lake for the holiday so he worked to get his parents to the Lake for the holiday as well.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 3rd Justin grabbed a bottle of wine and walked hand and hand with Lanier to the dock. Awaiting them on the dock was a chiminea filled with firewood. Justin lit the fire and he and Lanier sat down on the cool summer night in front of the fire, sipping wine, watching the stars, and talking about life. When the moment was right, Justin dropped to one knee and popped the question.</p>
<p>She said YES!! And now we want to celebrate our special day with you.</p>
